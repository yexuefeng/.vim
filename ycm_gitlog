    Auto merge of #2329 - micbou:keyboard-interrupt, r=vheon
    
    [READY] Handle keyboard interruption when evaluating Vim expression with user input
    
    When evaluating a Vim expression in Python that involves code expecting user input (e.g. `input()`, `inputlist()`, `complete_check()`, etc.), if this evaluation is interrupted by the user (with `CTRL-C` for instance), Vim will pass the interruption to the Python interpreter which in turn will raise a `KeyboardInterrupt` exception. We don't want these exceptions to be displayed to the user (because the way Vim handles Python exceptions is really annoying) so we catch them where appropriate.
    
    Fixes #2289.

    [READY] Do not send BufferVisit and FileReadyToParse notification events when current allowed buffer has not changed
    
    See discussion in PR #2265 and the commit message.
    
    Since only the `BufEnter` autocommand event is concerned, we are splitting `s:OnBufferVisit` in two functions:
     - `s:OnBufferRead`, identical to current `s:OnBufferVisit`, for the `BufRead` and `FileType` autocommand events;
     - `s:OnBufferEnter` for the `BufEnter` event.
    
    We only send the `BufferVisit` and `FileReadyToParse` event notifications to `ycmd` in `s:OnBufferEnter` when the entered buffer, in which we are allowed to complete, is different from the last one.
    
    Closes #2265.

    Trigger BufferVisit event only when buffer has changed
    
    When selecting candidates during completion, Vim jumps to the preview
    window (if enabled) and jumps back to the actual buffer, triggering
    twice the BufEnter autocommand event. This results in YCM sending
    two BufferVisit and one FileReadyToParse event notifications to
    ycmd, which is completely unnecessary since the current buffer
    did not change. We improve this by only sending these events when the
    entered buffer allowed to be completed has changed.

    Being interrupted by the `Press ENTER or type command to continue` prompt while writing code is annoying. This happens when an error occurs during completion and the error message displayed on the status line is longer than the window width. We prevent that by truncating the message.
    
    Note that the message logged to the command-line history will also be truncated.

    Avoid hit-enter prompts during completions
    
    When an error occurs during completions, a message is displayed on
    the status line. If this message is longer than the width of the

    into PostVimMessage.

    [READY] Fix diagnostic highlighting at line ending
    
    When highlighting a range of characters for a diagnostic, we make sure that the start and end positions do not go paste the line contents or the range will not be highlighted at all (don't ask, this is a Vim feature). However, we don't account for the end position not being included in the diagnostic range. So, when this position ends at line ending or after it, we move it just before the `EOL` character. Since the end position is not part of the range, this character will not be highlighted, which is not what we want. We fix this behavior by decrementing the end column before clamping it and incrementing it after.
    
    Fixes https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/issues/846.

    Auto merge of #2274 - micbou:improve-syntax-extraction, r=Valloric
    
    [READY] Improve extraction of keywords from syntax list
    
    This PR is an attempt at improving the extraction of keywords from Vim syntax files. Current approach is to go through the `syntax list` output and:
      - ignore lines where the first word is a reserved keyword for syntax highlighting except for `contained`;
      - ignore all words used by Vim as arguments in the syntax commands;
      - add remaining words to the list of identifiers.
    
    The main issue with this approach is that syntax arguments that could be valid language keywords are always ignored. There is also a bug where the `match` keyword is extracted while not being a language keyword (see the Python, C++, and Java tests).
    With the new approach, we try to ignore Vim keywords only when necessary, that is:
      - ignore `syntax match` (fix the `match` keyword bug) and `syntax region` commands: they mostly contain arguments, syntax groups and regular expressions;
      - ignore  `nextgroup=` if in first position and subsequent arguments `skipempty`, `skipwhite`, and `skipnl`;
      - ignore `contained` argument if in first position;
      - add remaining words to the list of identifiers.
    
    This strategy is based on observations of the `syntax list` output.

     - add remaining words to the list of identifiers.
    Fix a bug where the word "match" was extracted while not being a keyword
    of the syntax language.

    [READY] Rewrite syntax tests
    
    While trying to fix a bug when extracting identifiers from Vim syntax files, I found out that errors from syntax tests are not really helpful because `eq_` assertions don't tell which items are missing when comparing lists (or sets). So, we use matchers from hamcrest instead to get useful assertion errors.
    
    Note that with these changes, we don't test anymore if the value returned by `_KeywordsFromSyntaxListOutput` is a set. I don't think it's an issue but if you feel that's important, we can probably check for it too.

    [READY] Fix Python 3 bytes issue in ReplaceChunk function
    
    This PR updates the `ReplaceChunk` tests by using plain strings instead of byte objects to mimic Vim buffers returning byte objects on Python 2 and unicode objects on Python 3.
    
    We are only updating the tests for now to show that these changes make the tests fail on Python 3 with the same error as issue #2240.
    
    Fixes #2240.

    # Why this change is necessary and useful
    
    See PR https://github.com/Valloric/ycmd/pull/532
    
    This PR presents the user with a list to choose from supplied FixIt suggestions when there are multiple suggestions on the same line. This not only helps with the child diagnostics mentioned in the ycmd PR, but also for cases where there are simply 2 diagnostics on the current line; the user can now select which of them to apply. Previously the one closest to the cursor was applied (which was always the first one supplied from the server).
    
    I created a new `SelectFromList` method which uses `inputlist()` as the user interface from `confirm()` does not work well with long prompts. This interface is more like the suggestions when `set spell` is enabled, which should be familiar to many Vim users.
    
    I considered updating the "auto namespace import" c sharp stuff to use the new `SelectFromList` method, but we know that the current implementation of that functionality is broken, so cannot be widely used.

    # Why this change is necessary and useful
    
    Vim recently has introduced a new feature called 'packages', which
    permits, among the rest, to disable automatic loading a plugin at
    startup. Plugins that are disabled at startup may be manually loaded
    during a session using `:packadd` (see `:h packages`, `:h :packadd`).
    Of course, a plugin that is loaded after startup cannot rely on VimEnter
    events.
    
    In order to support lazy loading YCM, check whether YCM is sourced
    during startup or at a later time. In the former case, define an
    autocommand as before; in the latter case, enable YCM immediately.
    
    Why would one want to load YCM lazily? I use YCM only for certain file
    types (Python), and I prefer not to have pop up menus appearing
    all the time for other file types. In my workflow, I may enable YCM only
    if I start Vim for Python coding sessions.
    
    Tests not included because the change is in VimScript code only, and
    testing this feature is not trivial.

    Auto merge of #2190 - micbou:goto-set-quickfix-list, r=Valloric
    
    [READY] Use SetQuickFixList function for GoTo* subcommands
    
    From discussion in PR #2101, we reuse the `SetQuickFixList` function for the `GoTo*` subcommands. This automatically makes the quickfix window height equal to the number of locations.
    
    Unfortunately, there is no Vim option to change the default height (10) of the quickfix window so we can't really use the heuristic `min(number of Locations, default height)` because users would not be able to change the default height (and we don't want to add another option). However, there are still solutions to set a default height. For instance, a user could add the following line in its vimrc:
    ```viml
    autocmd FileType qf exe "20wincmd _"
    ```
    to set the default height to 20. This will override YCM behavior.
    
    I didn't reproduce the `lazyredraw` boilerplate from `youcompleteme#OpenGoToList`. I guess it was used to avoid flickering but I didn't experienced any without it. In addition, it was not properly implemented because the `lazyredraw` state was not preserved if the option was already set.
    I also threw away the `cclose` command. It resets the quickfix window to its default position if already opened, which I think is not a desirable behavior.
    
    Closes #2101.

    [READY] Fix LookupError exception when opening a file
    
    Fixes #2159.
    
    I think the issue is caused by `locale.getpreferredencoding()` returning an empty string on some configurations (especially on OS X with Python 2). This is [the value used by default when no encoding is specified](https://docs.python.org/2/library/io.html?highlight=open#io.open). The same error is raised if we do:
    ```python
    open( 'some_file', encoding = '' )
    ```

    - [X] **I understand my PR may be closed if it becomes obvious I didn't

    # Why this change is necessary and useful
    
    There are a number of recent errors with unicode (most of which caused by the server, see PR https://github.com/Valloric/ycmd/pull/455. In testing I fixed a number of client-side tracebacks also.
    
    This is by no means a comprehensive set of fixes for the client - I have simply fixed those that I came across in testing.
    
    Summary:
     - fixes for errors when typing in c-sharp files due to the completion done handler
     - fixes for FixIts to apply correctly with multi-byte characters
     - fixes for unicode characters in return from the omni completer

    Auto merge of #2151 - micbou:avoid-eval-vim-globals, r=Valloric
    
    [READY] Avoid evaluating Vim globals in Python
    
    ### Problem
    
    See the commit message and issue #2127.
    
    ### How to reproduce
    
    Make Vim to use Python 3 for YCM by either using Vim with only Python 3 support or by editing the `s:UsingPython2` function in `autoload/youcompleteme.vim` to always return 0.
    Create the following `vimrc`:
    ```
    set nocompatible
    
    set runtimepath+=~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
    
    set encoding=utf8
    
    filetype plugin indent on
    
    let g:dummy_variable = '€'[0]
    ```
    and start Vim with it. The following error will occur:
    ```
    YouCompleteMe unavailable: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 0: unexpected end of data
    ```
    with the traceback in `:messages`:
    ```python
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<string>", line 24, in <module>
      File "C:\\Users\\micbou\\.vim\\bundle\\YouCompleteMe\\autoload\..\python\ycm\setup.py", line 49, in SetUpYCM
        base.LoadJsonDefaultsIntoVim()
      File "C:\\Users\\micbou\\.vim\\bundle\\YouCompleteMe\\autoload\..\python\ycm\base.py", line 60, in LoadJsonDefaultsIntoVim
        vimsupport.LoadDictIntoVimGlobals( vim_defaults, overwrite = False )
      File "C:\\Users\\micbou\\.vim\\bundle\\YouCompleteMe\\autoload\..\python\ycm\vimsupport.py", line 305, in LoadDictIntoVimGlobals
        extend_option ) )
    UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 0: unexpected end of data
    ```
    
    ### Solution
    
    Do not evaluate the Vim globals when loading the YCM default options into Vim and when building the options for the ycmd server.
    
    Depending on the number of global variables and custom YCM options, this may be slower or faster than the current code but by a negligible margin (~1ms).
    
    Fixes #2127 and #2150.

commit b923431d7d330d9fd7218f2007b280e3b7083647
Author: micbou <contact@micbou.com>
Date:   Sat Apr 30 18:14:48 2016 +0200

    Avoid evaluating Vim globals in Python
    
    On Python 3, evaluating a Vim expression will raise a unicode exception
    if it contains an invalid sequence of bytes for the current encoding.
    We can't really do anything about it because this is the way Vim and
    Python 3 interact. However, we can prevent this situation to occur by
    not evaluating Vim data that we have no control over: in particular,
    the Vim globals. This is done by:
     - adding one by one the YCM default options instead of extending the
       Vim globals with them;
     - only evaluating the Vim global variable names (and not their values)
       when building the YCM options for the ycmd server.

    Add error messages when ycmd crashed
    
    Display an error message to the user depending on the status code
    returned by the ycmd server.
    Remove ycm_core checks in plugin/youcompleteme.vim. These checks are
    now done by the ycmd server.
    Do not start a separate process to check the core version but rely on
    ycmd returning a specific exit code. This slightly improves the Vim
    startup time.

commit bf63188066c0cbe9a469bfd7e0d8b695c50f33f8
Author: Lifepillar <github@lifepillar.com>

    Support lazy loading with :packadd.
    
    Vim recently has introduced a new feature called 'packages', which
    permits, among the rest, to disable automatic loading a plugin at
    startup. Plugins that are disabled at startup may be manually loaded
    during a session using :packadd (see :h packages, :h :packadd). Of
    course, a plugin that is loaded after startup cannot rely on VimEnter
    events.
    
    In order to support lazy loading YCM, check whether YCM is sourced
    during startup or at a later time. In the former case, define an
    autocommand as before; in the latter case, enable YCM immediately.

    I spent a while trying to find where I had written the instructions for building python with pyenv to work with YCM, then I thought the README was a good place for it.
    
    ycmd must use pythons with `--enable-shared` or `--enable-framework` else boom.

    As requested in https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/issues/2052#issuecomment-195631106 I'm sending this PR. I've marked it as WIP because I've renamed only the `ycmd` option and that is because keeping the backward compatibility here was straight forward since is a client only option. For the jedihttp option instead I would like some opinion on how to procede: should we keep the backward compatibility here on the client or should we make the backward compatibility layer on the ycmd side? Keeping it here would be easier but it would mean that other clients should implement this theirself. Thoughts?

    Fixes https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/issues/2036
    
    I'm submitting this without tests for now because it's probably quite important, and adding tests is going to be quite time consuming because we somehow need to mock out the output of `:syntax list` with unicode chars, etc.
    
    I have tested manually and got people experiencing the issue to also confirm that it fixes it.
    
    I've also surveyed other uses of `vim.eval` that return string and wrapped them in a `ToUnicode` where there is a possibility of it not working. This is much more speculative, so feel free to say ditch this and just fix the issue at hand.
    
    Also, of course feel free to say we can't merge this without tests, which is also valid :)

    [READY] Do not send request in OnFileReadyToParse function if server is down
    
    Even if `ycmd` process is terminated, YCM will try to send the `event_notification` request in `OnFileReadyToParse` function, blocking Vim for one second if the server crashed at the start (because of [this request](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/blob/master/python/ycm/client/base_request.py#L222)) or resulting in a traceback with  `ConnectionError` exception otherwise. This will happen for the `InsertLeave`, `CursorMoved`, `CursorHold`, `BufferVisit` events, making Vim almost unusable.
    
    This is fixed by returning early if the process is terminated.

    # Why this change is necessary and useful
    
    Python is a dynamic language and as a result shares the dynamic language mentality of "Fail Late". Admittedly, Python fails earlier than most dynamic languages, but in any case it is extremely useful to have static analysis and syntax checking tools available prior to runtime execution.
    
    YCM uses flake8 for this as part of its test runs. However, due to code _style_ being more important to most of the checkers than code _quality_, we have not always taken full advantage (for example, syntax checking was disabled). This PR continues https://github.com/Valloric/ycmd/pull/416 and adds the same set of checks to YCM client.
    
    This benefits developers because it speeds up the code/test cycle (using Syntactic now requires _no_ additional configuration for flake8 to be correct for YCM and ycmd), and benefits users, because we should produce better quality code :)
    
    This PR also updates to the latest ycmd to include https://github.com/Valloric/ycmd/pull/416

    In PR #2016, we have changed the way we are catching exceptions on requests by only catching the `ServerError` instead of all exceptions, which is great for debugging purposes. However, due to this change, we don't catch the exception from a timed out request, leading to a ugly traceback in Vim. This PR fixes that.

    Auto merge of #2016 - Valloric:py3, r=micbou
    
    [READY] Making YCM run in Vim with only python3
    
    Since https://github.com/Valloric/ycmd/pull/358, ycmd has supported Python 3. Now's the time to make the YCM client work in Python 3 too. As with the ycmd PR, **until we merge this, no other code-changing PR should be merged.** We need to get to a state where we have green Travis for Python 3 before any other PRs start landing.
    
    This was substantially easier than porting ycmd, but it was still a massive pain. It's likely to fail in certain corner cases, so please give this a spin!
    
    The best way to test it out is to build a Vim that has only Python 3 support. Our wiki page on [building Vim from source](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/wiki/Building-Vim-from-source) is a great start; you'll probably need to change `--enable-pythoninterp` to `--enable-python3interp` and similar for `--with-python-config-dir`. Or just get yourself a beta image of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and run it in a VM (16.04 doesn't even ship Python 2 in the base image!). You can verify that you're running the right Vim by looking at the output of `vim --version`. It should have `-python` and `+python3`.

    Ensuring vimsupport only returns unicode text
    
    Python 3 is much stricter around mixing bytes with unicode (and by
    "stricter," I mean it doesn't allow it at all) so we're making
    vimsupport only return `unicode` objects (`str` on py3). The idea is
    that YCM (and ycmd) internals only ever deal with unicode.

    Auto merge of #1917 - puremourning:fixit-multiple-files-upstream, r=Valloric
    
    [READY] Support FixIt and Refactor commands across multiple files
    
    ## Apply FixIt chunks across files
    
    Previously, FixIts could only apply to the current buffer. Now we can apply FixIts across files, even if they are not currently open in the user's Vim. We obey existing configuration about how/where to open new files and apply changes in such a way as to not scribble the user's filesystem, and allow full undo history, like existing FixIt commands. Vim's python API actually makes this really quite easy.
    
    To achieve this, we sort the chunks by filename, apply the existing logic unchanged. The only difference is that `ReplaceChunk` no longer implicitly assumes it applies to `vim.current.buffer`.
    
    ## Recognise 'FixIt' responses for any subcommand
    
    Previously, we used the subcommand name to determine the type of response to expect. This coupled the client and the server and didn't allow us to apply FixIts for a "Refactor" command, or "GoTo" for a, theoretical "Find" command.
    
    Now 'GoTo' and 'FixIt' commands don't need to start with those prefixes. For 'FixIt' we can detect the response type by looking for the 'fixits' entry in the response.
    
    ## Other changes
    
    The `vimsupport.OpenFilename` method needed to handle the presence of Vim swap files and the various user responses. This pushed the cyclomatic complexity over the threshold, so the code was partially obfuscated to accommodate the cyclomatic complexity gods.

    Add docs for RefactorRename
    
    Additionally, we restructure subcommands section to organise by
    command type.
    
    There are now a significant number of subcommands offering quite
    powerful features. A flat-list of such commands is not easy for users to
    discover (citation needed). Restructured into:
     - GoTo commands
     - Documenation/type information commands
     - FixIt/refactor commands
    
    This has the following benefits:
     - features are more discoverable to the user (due to contents page
       update)
     - more obvious where to add new subcommand documentation
     - a place to write notes which apply to multiple commands (such as
       jump lists, multi-file refactor)

    Support FixIt commands across buffers
    
    We simply apply the changes to each file in turn. The existing replacement
    logic is unchanged, except that it now no longer implicitly assumes we are
    talking about the current buffer.
    
    If a buffer is not visible for the requested file name, we open it in
    a horizontal split, make the edits, then hide the window. Because this
    can cause UI flickering, and leave hidden, modified buffers around, we
    issue a warning to the user stating the number of files for which we are
    going to do this. We pop up the quickfix list at the end of applying
    the edits to allow the user to see what we changed.
    
    If the user opts to abort due to, say, the file being open in another
    window, we simply raise an error and give up, as undoing the changes
    is too complex to do programatically, but trivial to do manually in such
    a rare case.

    Remove knowlegde from YCM about subcommand names
    
    Now 'GoTo' and 'FixIt' commands don't need to start with those
    prefixes. For 'FixIt' we can detect the response type by looking for
    the 'fixits' entry in the response.
    
    For 'GoTo' this is a touch harder, as there is no completely obvious
    way to tell. However it is unique in this respect, so we can simply
    fall back to it.
    
    Completers returning other types of response are not supported by
    this client.

    Auto merge of #1927 - micbou:event-notification-test, r=Valloric
    
    [READY] Fix issue in EventNotification tests
    
    While I was reviewing PR #1905, I found an issue with the `EventNotification` tests. It's easy to reproduce. You just need to comment [this line in `python/ycm/youcompleteme.py`](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/blob/master/python/ycm/youcompleteme.py#L508) and run the tests. With this change, the `EventNotification` tests should fail since the second call of `ValidateParseRequest` re-raises the warning. However, tests are still passing because `assert_has_calls` does not check if a call was not made. For example, if `functionA` is called twice, both `assert_has_calls( [ functionA ] )` and `assert_has_calls( [ functionA, functionA ] )` are successful.
    
    To fix this, we just need to check the number of calls using `call_count`. This is done by creating a subclass of `MagicMock` implementing the `assert_has_exact_calls` method and using it in tests.

    [READY] Implement new strategy to find the Python interpreter path
    
    See discussion in issue #1891 for details.
    
    Implement a new strategy to find the Python interpreter path:
      - if specified, use `g:ycm_path_to_python_interpreter` option.
      - on UNIX platforms, use `sys.executable` as the path to Python interpreter;
      - on Windows, deduce it from `os.__file__` path (it should always be in the parent folder).
    
    In all cases, check the version (2.6 or 2.7) of the Python interpreter path by running it.
    
    This PR may break things. It needs thorough testing.

    In embedders, sys.executable may contain a Vim path instead of a Python

    Add tests for this regex.

    Simplify `_NotifyUserIfServerCrashed` method by using `CheckFilename` function from `vimsupport` module.

    Mentioning the need for racer flag in Rust section
    
    This covers users that have already installed YCM before and are looking
    to set up Rust completion. They're unlikely to start reading from the
    Installation section, so we mention the need for the new build flag to
    prevent "why doesn't it work for me" confusion.

    Auto merge of #1876 - puremourning:fix-goto-references, r=micbou
    
    [READY] Fix GoTo lists arriving at the wrong column.
    
    ## Problem
    
    When a `GoTo` command returns a list of destinations, such as declarations and definitions in Python and references in JavaScript, we pop the Vim quick fix list with a list of destinations. however, we always jump to the character before the actual declaration/definition.
    
    ## Resolution
    
    Vim's QuickFix lists require 1-based columns, which is what is returned from ycmd's commands, so don't subtract 1 from the column number.
    
    As noted in the comments, the Vim documentation for `setqflist` is somewhat vague about this "byte offset", but it is confirmed to mean "1-based column number" both in testing and in `:help getqflist`.
    
    ## Manual testing
    
    Tested this with the Tern completer (`:YcmCompleter GoToReferences`) and Jedi completer (`:YcmCompleter GoToDeclaration`). For the Jedi completer, use something like:
    
    ```python
    x = 1
    if False:
      x = 2
    else:
      x = 3
    
    print( str(x) )
    ```
    
    Then `:YcmCompleter GoToDeclaration` on `x`. This returns a list, which pops up the quick fix window.
    
    *Previous behaviour*
    
    Previously, the jump would go to the character before the actual declaration (i.e. the `<space>` before `x` in each line)
    
    ## Automated testing
    
    Just some simple execution of the changed code, proving that we don't take 1 from the column.

    KeyError: 'word'
    ```
    It happens because the Vim variable `v:completed_item` is empty. From Vim documentation on `v:completed_item`:
    
    > Dictionary containing the complete-items for the most 	recently completed word after CompleteDone.  **The Dictionary is empty if the completion failed**.
    
    ### Solution
    
    Check if `v:completed_item` is empty before accessing its `word` key.

    [READY] Add JavaScript completion using Tern completer
    
    ## JavaScript completer
    
    Adds support for native JavaScript completion using ycmd's Tern completer.
    
    WIP because relies on #1848 to be merged first.
    
    This PR:
    
    - Adds functional documentation to the README.md
    - Adds configuration documentation to the README.md
    - Updates the vim doc inline with the above
    - And, most importantly, updates `ycmd` submodule to include the Tern completer and the additional fixes.
    
    ## ycmd changes
    
    There are quite a lot of commits going in to ycmd. Here's a summary of the PRs:

    Auto merge of #1848 - puremourning:file-ready-to-parse, r=vheon
    
    [READY] Raise warnings on FileReadyToParse for completers not supporting diagnostics
    
    Fixes #1829
    
    ## Background
    
    Detailed analysis is available on [the issue](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/issues/1829). But principally: if the filetype being edited is not a filetype suporting YCM native diagnostics, then warnings, errors, etc. (including the "unknown extra conf" warning/prompt) are not displayed after the "FileReadyToParse" `event_notification`
    
    ## Resolution
    
    The approach is: for filetypes which do not support diagnostics, rather than ignoring all `FileReadyToParse` event responses, simply call the `Response` method, which raises the appropriate error or handles the "confirm extra-conf" behaviour. Any other data returned by the completer (such as diagnostics!), are simply ignored.
    
    ## Manual Testing
    
    Tested with tern completer which raises an error if the `.tern-project` file is not found.
    Tested with a modified tern completer with the following `OnFileReadyToParse`:
    
    ```python
      def OnFileReadyToParse( self, request_data ):
        self._WarnIfMissingTernProject()
    
        module = extra_conf_store.ModuleForSourceFile( request_data[ 'filepath' ] )
        if not module:
          if not self._raised_extra_conf_warning:
            self._raised_extra_conf_warning = True
            raise NoExtraConfDetected
          return
    
        # use module!
    ```
    
    Results all as expected:
    
    - with no `.tern-config`: tern config warning (once)
    - with `.tern-config`, but no `.ycm_extra_conf`: no extra conf warning (once)
    - with `.tern-config` and `.ycm_extra_conf`: confirmation prompt (once)
    
    ## Automated Testing
    
    This was a marathon. Or a mockathon, I suppose.
    
    Briefly:
    
    - I wrote a `event_notification_test.py` which tests these new `YouCompleteMe` object behaviours, via a complex series of mocking
    - I had to refactor the `postcomplete_tests.py` to prevent it from leaving `MagicMock` instances all over the place because this lead to the above test failing (apparently) randomly
    - In order to debug the above shenanigans I updated `run_tests.py` to allow passing arguments to nosetests, like we do in `ycmd`
    
    There are more comments in the code and on the various commit messages, explaining what's going on.
    
    With regard to style, there is quite a lot of:
    
    ```python
    
    @contextlib.contextmanager
    def something():
      with patch(this):
        with patch(that):
          with patch(the_other):
            yield
    
    @patch( foo )
    def do_a_test( foo ):
      with something():
        do_a_thing()
        assert foo.called()
    ```
    
    The reason for this relative ugliness is that there is a lot of boilerplate mocking code. Because of a number of foibles of `mock` and the versions of python we support, I found this to be the least hacky way of ensuring that everything was cleaned up and was relatively sane to read and maintain.
    
    Explanation for the `with`-ception that is going on:
    
    - @patch is my preferred method, but it is more difficult to comment well and doesn't work when used with `@contextlib.contextmanager`, so you have to use `with`
    - multiple managers in a single `with` statement is not supported in Python 2.6
    - `contextlib.nested` is deprecated and buggy (apparently)

    Prevent postcomplete_tests.py from leaving mock object lying around
    
    Previously, running postcomplete_tests.py could lead to MagicMock objects being

    Further, by using mock.patch appropriately, tests withing postcomplete_tests.py
    no longer rely on mocking performed by previous tests (and can be successfully
    run individually)

    Currently, only `all` snippets are displayed by YCM because UltiSnips is called without setting the buffer filetypes. See issue #1818.
    
    This is fixed by using UltiSnips methods `reset_buffer_filetypes` and `add_buffer_filetypes`.

    Expose functions to get error and warning counts
    
    @Valloric I've implemented two functions which resolve #1011
    
    The interface exposed to Vim is:
    
    ```viml
    youcompleteme#GetErrorCount()
    youcompleteme#GetWarningCount()
    ```
    
    Below is a rough example of how these methods can be used to integrate with other plugins. In this case Lightline has been extended to show the error and warning count as red and yellow sections on the end of the status line, respectively.

    Handle canonical response from subcommands
    
    In continuation to PR #1805, when the ycmd server returns a canonical type (boolean, number, string, etc.), we should print it to the user.
    
    For example, this applies to the `SolutionFile` C♯ subcommand which only returns a string (actually, this could be improved in the completer).
    
    This also fixes a thrown exception when the response is not iterable (a number for example).

    Auto merge of #1760 - micbou:ycm-toggle-logs, r=Valloric
    
    Introducing :YcmToggleLogs command
    
    Two approaches were proposed in PR #1753:
    - open the stdout and stderr logfiles in Vim windows or close them if already opened: `:YcmToggleLogs`;
    - open one of the logfiles in the preview window by specifying it as an argument in the command: `:YcmShowLog <stdout|stderr>`.
    
    This PR merges both approaches by adding an optional argument (`Stdout` or `Stderr`) to the first approach. When no argument is given, both logfiles are opened (or closed if already opened).
    
    With this approach, we cannot use the preview window because only one such window is allowed by Vim. So, we simulate it by adding properties specific to the preview window (horizontal split, height, etc.)
    
    Since they are multiple ways to open a file in Vim, I added a generic function `OpenFilename` for this. It makes easy to customize the way logfiles are opened and could be useful for new features.
    
    Tests were a pain to add and I am not sure of the way I implemented them. If someone could review them. There is some refactoring of the Vim mock.
    
    I updated the documentation and the contribution guidelines. I added a new instruction when creating an issue: adding the output of the `:YcmDebugInfo` command. We often ask it in the issues.
    
    I suggest fetching the `ycm-toggle-logs` branch of my repository to test yourself this command.

    Run tests on OS X
    
    There should be no difference between the behaviour on OS X and the behaviour on other platforms as all of the tests are python. However, running them is cheap and proves that there are no differences.
    
    The approach is to import the scripts from `ycmd` with a couple of modifications:
         - don't set `YCM_CORES=1` as we didn't before, and this makes the build a lot faster
         - don't install `gcc-4.8` as we didn't before
         - install `argparse` for the tests as it is not available in python2.6

    Fix AppVeyor configuration
    
    We need to explicitly call the run_tests script with python. Otherwise,
    the script is not properly executed.

    Auto merge of #1753 - micbou:remove-vim-stdout-option, r=Valloric
    
    Remove g:ycm_server_use_vim_stdout option
    
    The `g:ycm_server_use_vim_stdout` option is not working like expected. ycmd logs are not written to the console when using the gui client with this option enabled. This is the case on Windows and I think @puremourning can confirm this on other platforms. Worse, it also makes the ycmd server unresponsive on Windows.
    
    It's a big issue because we recommend to use this option in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
    
    This PR removes the option and updates the contribution guidelines by asking the user to put the `let g:ycm_server_keep_logfiles = 1` option instead.
    
    To further improve the debugging process, I would like to add a new command `:YcmToggleLogs` (thanks to @puremourning for the idea) that automatically open or close the ycmd stdout and stderr logs as windows in Vim. If you agree, I'll send another PR adding the command.
    
    Note: if you are wondering why the ycmd stdout logs are always empty while you are adding print statements in the ycmd code, this is because the output needs to be flushed: `sys.stdout.flush()`.

    Vim commands (`YcmDebugInfo`, `YcmCompleter`, etc.) should not be defined if an error is encountered when processing the `s:SetUpPython` function. Why? Because those commands will return errors like `name 'ycm_state' is not defined`.

    Auto merge of #1694 - puremourning:detailed-info-subcommands, r=Valloric
    
    Allow subcommands to display information in the preview window
    
    References
    ====
    
    https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/issues/1653
    
    There will be some PRs coming to ycmd that will supply documentation in this format
    
    Background
    ====
    
    This adds support to YCM for displaying "detailed info" (e.g. quick-info, documentation, etc.) from a completer subcommand response. We display the info in the preview window.
    
    Technical notes
    ====
    
    Use of the preview window
    ----
    
    We display the detailed info text in the preview window. Vim's preview window is designed to display actual files, not scratch data. Our approach is to open a temporary file, even though that file is never  written. This way, all of Vim's existing settings for the preview window (and people's configured mappings) just work. This is also consistent with showing the documentation in the preview
    window during completion (although, Vim fixes the preview window height to 3 in that case).
    
    Other plugins have more complicated functions for this (such as eclim), or Scratch.vim, but this approach is simple and doesn't require external dependencies or additional settings.
    
    
     `wincmd P` etc.
    ---
    
    The approach in `vimsupport.py` of jumping around with `wincmd P` and `wincmd p` was taken pretty much directly from vim's `:help preview-window` (specifically `:help CursorHold-example`), so while ugly it is apparently the 'recommended' way.
    
    `vim` module mocking
    ----
    
    I had to change the way we were mocking the `vim` module in the tests. From the commit message:
    
        This required fixing a sort-of-bug in which the mock'd Vim module was always
        only set once, and could not be changed outside of the module which created it.
        This meant that it wasn't easy to have arbitrary tests, because it was dependent
        on the order in which the tests execute as to whether the return from
        MockVimModule() was actually the one in use.
    
        The solution was to make the mock'd vim module a singleton, imported by any
        tests which require fiddling with it. This should hopefully help testing going
        forwards.
    
    I committed this separately to help review (hopefully).

    The solution was to make the mock'd vim module a singleton, and use mock's
    patch decorator to assign new MagicMock() instances to those methods in the vim
    module which a particular test is interested in.

    Auto merge of #1636 - mispencer:CsAddImport, r=puremourning
    
    Add required namespace in C# after completing
    
    When forcing semantic completion with the keybind, C# completions can return a list of importable types. These types are from namespaces which havn't been imported, and thus are not valid to use without also adding their namespace's import statement. This change makes YCM automatically insert the necessary using statement to import that namespace on completion completion. In the case there are multiple possible namespaces, it prompts you to choose one.
    
    Demo:
    ![c namespaceinsertdemo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1434266/9337289/b7994542-459b-11e5-8f52-e48af76a3aab.gif)
    
    By default, the using statement is inserted after the last using statement. If there aren't any, it's inserted before the first line. This behavior is customization by setting a function to the vim global ``g:ycm_cs_insert_namespace_function``. I implemented this in pure vimscript largely so I could provide such customization...
    
    Caveats: vim does not provide a way to get which completion was inserted. To get this, we store the completions, hook the CompleteDone event, and check than if the preceding text matches any of the completions. This is imperfect, and sometimes matches when it shouldn't. Also, the CompleteDone event requires 7.3.598 or newer.

    Correct FixIt chunks sorting
    
    While playing with FixIts in C++, I found the following issue. When fixing the third line in the code:
    ```cpp
    template<int Value> struct CT { template<typename> struct Inner; };
    
    CT<10 >> 2> ct; // expected-warning{{require parentheses}}
    ```
    the following result is obtained:
    ```cpp
    CT<1(0 >> 2)> ct; // expected-warning{{require parentheses}}
    ```
    which is obviously wrong.
    
    The issue is YouCompleteMe does not replace the chunks in the right order. It starts by adding the closing parenthesis, add one to the delta and inserts the opening parenthesis in the wrong place cause of the delta.
    
    We actually use the expression `str(line) + ',' + str(column)` to sort the chunks by line then column whereas it should simply be `(line, column)`.
    
    This PR fixes this issue, adds two tests which are failing in the current version, refactors the `_HandleFixitResponse` function and cleans up code.

    Add CompleteDone hook, with namespace insertion for C#
    
    Add a new vim hook on CompleteDone. This hook is called when a
    completions is selected.
    
    When forcing semantic completion with the keybind, C# completions can
    return a list of importable types. These types are from namespaces which
    havn't been imported, and thus are not valid to use without also adding
    their namespace's import statement. This change makes YCM automatically
    insert the necessary using statement to import that namespace on
    completion completion. In the case there are multiple possible
    namespaces, it prompts you to choose one.

    Auto merge of #1555 - puremourning:fixit, r=Valloric
    
    [RFC] YCM Client support for FixIt commands
    
    This change provides the client-side support in YouCompleteMe for vim providing a new :YcmFixIt command which applies changes to the vim buffer to implement trivial fixes to common coding errors where the completer provides instructions on how to fix a diagnostic. A note is added "(FixIt)" to the diagnostic text echo'd in vim when a FixIt is available.
    
    While this may seem out of the scope of ycmd/YouCompleteMe (as a completion engine), I think it is a really useful feature, and provided straight out of libclang. so I'm sending this slightly incomplete PR (along with the associated ycmd change) to see what the appetite is within the user and maintainer community, and to get feedback on the approach.
    
    I know that I need to write some tests, and perhaps tidy up some TODOs, but I would really appreciate any feedback on the approach. Also, I should confess that I haven't yet run the existing tests as I'm having trouble getting them to run on my mac. Hoping that travis will help me out :)
    
    I know I also need to update the readme.
    
    Testing has been performed manually by going through the list of .c, .cpp and .m files in clang's tests/FixIt folder and ensuring that by hitting :YcmFixIt (actually "@:" a lot!) on each diagnostic, the diagnostic went away (assuming a FixIt was available). I also mangled a number of the clang test such that the fix was spread across multiple lines, etc.
    
    I also haven't tested this with completers other than clang completer (due to having trouble one with diagnostics getting them to work) , but of course I will prior to this being ready to merge.
    
    I also understand that adding the vim modelines might be divisive, but the standard in this project doesn't match my usual setting :) Happy to remove them if people react angrily.
    
    Once again thanks for the time and a great (and improving!) product.

    useful when starting the ycmd server, it is only set in this case.

    Auto merge of #1545 - micbou:echom-redraw, r=Valloric
    
    Redraw the screen before displaying a message
    
    There has been several complaints about the message "ValueError: File is less than 5 lines long; not compiling". See issues #814, #1364, #1544. In fact, I believe the issue is not the message itself but the infamous "Press ENTER or type command to continue" prompt when editing a new C-family file.
    
    For example, if I create the file `foo.c`, Vim will display the line `"foo.c" [New file]` and then YouCompleteMe will display `ValueError: File is less than 5 lines long; not compiling`. Since there are now two lines, the hit-enter message is prompted. By redrawing the screen just before displaying the message from YouCompleteMe, only one line appears and we avoid this behavior.
    
    Tested on Linux and Windows.

    Push check for NativeFiletypeCompletionUsable down
    
    Another way in which the commit d768447 forced the client to wait for
    the server to start was the UpdateDiagnosticNotifications call from the
    FileReadyToParse which is called right after a buffer is loaded. In any
    way if we don't have any previous FileReadyToParse request done for the
    current file we bail out, so we we can wait for a FileReadyToParse
    response to be available before asking if a completer is usable for the
    current filetype.

    Defer setting the omnifunc.
    
    When we enter a new buffer we need to know if the ycmd server has a
    native completer for the current filetype, this means that when we start
    vim we need to know if the server has a completer available for the
    buffer which means that we have to wait for the server to be up and
    running. To mitigate this defer the setting of the omnifunction closer
    to its need which is when we enter insert mode; this should give room
    for the ycmd server to start before we ask for anything or at least
    should reduce the time waiting.

    Check the server end point for available completer
    
    Previously we were checking if the `hook.py` file existed for the given
    filetype. ycmd has an endpoint for checking if given a filetype a
    semantic completer is available. To avoid redundant requests we cache
    those requests for every filetype. A semantic engine cannot be added
    *after* the ycmd server is started so to avoid redundant requests we
    cache those requests for every filetype and we clear the cache at server
    setup, in this way if we issue a `YcmRestartServer` command the server
    will be setup again and if a semantic completer is available we can use
    it. Should fix #1284.

Date:   Thu Feb 12 12:22:20 2015 +0000

    Support completer commands that return text …
    
    This is required to allow the ycmd GetType and GetParent subcommands to echo
    their reults in vim. The apporach is to display any text returned from a
    subcommand in the 'message' property assuming that the command is not a known
    'GoTo' command.

    Fix handling of signs placed by other plugins
    
    It appears to address numerous amount of issues, including: #812, #801, #887.
    
    Proposed solution uses dummy sign which is placed before updating
    diagnostic signs and unplaced afterwards, which eliminates any
    flickering. Also, it not just unplace all, it unplaces only that marks
    that are changed, so performance should not be an issue in case of many
    diagnostic messages.
    
    It's common solution that can be found in some vim plugins that manage
    signatures.

    Allow '*' in ycm_filetype_specific_completion_to_disable.
    
    I love YCM's auto popup with keyword completion when power typing but
    would rather not have semantic completion activate unless I really want
    it to (most semantic completers are somewhat slow and sometimes end up
    breaking my flow). When in API exploration mode, I don't mind having
    to press C-Space to force completion and wait a bit more.
    
    Unless I'm mistaken, the current code does not allow wildcards in the
    specification of filetypes on which to disable automatic semantic
    completion. This change allows the use of '*' to disable automatic
    semantic completion in all files.

    Fixing race condition on server crash
    
    Crash handling code tried to read stderr log file, but the file can be deleted
    by the server befor we get to look at it. In such a case, we post a different
    error message (without the log output).
    
    Point is we do our best to get the error output if the user doesn't have
    g:ycm_server_keep_logfiles set. If we can't get the logfile, oh well. We tell
    the user to set that flag if they care.

    http://llvm.org/releases/3.3/clang+llvm-3.3-amd64-Ubuntu-12.04.2.tar.gz and http://llvm.org/releases/3.4/clang+llvm-3.4-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-13.10.tar.xz.
    
    These headers don't appear to be arch dependent, so we should be good.

    ycmd watchog timer now wiser about machine sleep
    
    We now make sure we don't terminate ycmd if we skipped a watchdog wakeup
    time. If we skipped a check, that means the machine probably went to sleep and
    the client might still actually be up. In such cases, we give it one more wait
    interval to contact us before we die.

    YCM client now sends utf-8 encoded JSON.
    
    Previously, we'd just use json.dumps() to dump out JSON. By default,
    ensure_ascii is set to true and non-ASCII chars are encoded as \uXXXX.
    
    Problems seem to happen with other text in the data then not being utf8. I'm not
    sure why, still can't repro. This should go away now that we explicitly build a
    unicode string which we then encode as utf8.
    
    Hopefully fixes #821.

    Made changes to the install.sh to recognize .dll.a files on CYGWIN
    allowing it to discover PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR and PYTHON_LIBRARY
    
    Also changed wrap_python.hpp to only check for defined(__CYGWIN__)
    on 32-bit systems. Previously this check was OR'd with the check
    for defined(__WIN32__) causing the system to erroneously update the
    SIZEOF_LONG value and subsequently resulting in "make ycm_core"
    failing with "LONG_BIT definition appears wrong for platform" on
    CYGWIN-64 systems.

    If it takes a while to compile the user's C++ file, the YCM client/server may

    Changing copyright headers from me to Google
    
    When I initially released this project, I released it under my own copyright. I
    have since then worked on it in my 20% time at Google (and want to continue
    doing this) and my life becomes much simpler if the copyright is Google's.
    
    From the perspective of how this project is run and managed, **NOTHING**
    changes. YCM is not a Google product, merely a project run by someone who just
    happens to work for Google.
    
    Please note that the license of the project is **NOT** changing.

    in. People who sent in pull requests that were merged in the past will get an

    Revert "Only removing our signs in buffer, no all"
    
    This reverts commit 182848050e412e3b46f09e928ecc23d32ae9cea1.
    
    The reason we are reverting this is because removing signs in a loop causes
    flicker. The only non-flicker approach is to remove all signs in a buffer with
    "sign unplace buffer=<buffer-num>".
    
    So no compatibility with other plugins for us.

    Working around a Vim bug that causes flickering.
    
    If the user had a hidden buffer and a recent version of Vim, the screen would
    flicker every time the user typed. This was caused by a Vim bug.
    
    On every key press, we end up calling GetUnsavedAndCurrentBufferData(), which
    calls GetBufferOption( buffer_object, 'ft' ). If the buffer_object represents a
    hidden buffer, Vim would flicker.
    
    This would happen because we'd call "buffer_object.options[ 'ft' ]" in recent
    versions of Vim, and that line of code causes Vim to flicker. I don't know why.
    We're extracting the 'ft' value without going through buffer_object.options, and
    that works just fine.
    
    Fixes #669.

    Candidate overlap with buffer text improved
    
    Now, "foobar.h" will be changed to insert "foo" if the text after the cursor is
    "bar.h". This already worked for "foobar" and "bar", but the overlap search
    would stop before a non-word character. This has now been resolved.

    Preventing traceback for detailed diagnostic
    
    Previously we'd show a Python traceback if the user asked for a detailed
    diagnostic in a file that wasn't supported by Clang (something written in Python
    perhaps). Now we show an nice, far less scary message informing the user of
    this.

    Better handling of unknown extra conf files
    
    Previously, we'd implicitly turn off future notices about unknown extra conf
    files if we already raised one exception about it. This breaks when the user
    ends up not receiving the "unknown extra conf, load?" message.
    
    Now we only turn off the notice as a result of the user saying "don't load this"
    so that if the first request fails to reach them, they'll get a second (and
    third etc) request about it.

    Fixed usage of database file in example .ycm_extra_conf.py.
    
    Checking the path is set is not enough, we should also check the path
    exists. This allows people to have a general-purpose
    .ycm_extra_conf.conf that automatically loads a database file if exists,
    and falls back to the manual flags if not.

    Omnisharp: smarter solution file finder
    
    When loading the Omnisharp server, YCM tries to find a suitable solution
    file to feed it. Instead of giving up when finding multiple solution
    files, it now tries to find one named like the edited files' folder at
    the solution level, e.g. if we have bla/Project.sln and we are editing
    bla/Project/Folder/Whatever/File.cs, we use bla/Project.sln.

    Removing the server_idle_suicide_seconds option
    
    This option existed so that the user can tweak it if they found the default idle
    timeout too short, for instance if they leave their machine on over the weekend.
    
    This use case is now covered by the new YcmdKeepalive system that pings ycmd
    every 10 minutes as long as Vim is running. This prevents ycmd shutting down if
    one leaves their Vim instance alone for a long time.
    
    Thus the old option is useless now; ycmd now shuts down after 3 hours of
    inactivity, which should only ever happen when its corresponding Vim instance
    has shut down abnormally.

    Use a thread pool that doesn't join workers
    
    By default, a ThreadPoolExecutor will wait at Python interpreter shutdown for
    all the threads to stop by themselves before letting the interpreter shut down.
    
    We don't want that for the network requests thread pool, it causes a shutdown
    latency if there are outstanding requests. Killing the threads in our pool is
    perfectly safe so we can avoid the latency by introducing an
    UnsafeThreadPoolExecutor.

    New ycmd watchdog kills server when idle too long
    
    Defaults are kill server after 12 hours of inactivity; the reason why it's 12
    hours and not less is because we don't want to kill the server when the user
    just left his machine (and Vim) on during the night.

    If we install an explicit signal handler for SIGTERM and SIGINT and then call

    Better handling of crashed ycmd; restart command
    
    Previously the YCM Vim client would go bonkers when ycmd crashed. Now the user
    can continue using Vim just without YCM functionality.
    
    Also added a :YcmRestartServer command to let the user restart ycmd if it
    crashed. With a little luck, this will be rarely necessary.

    Now using new ycm_client_support shared lib
    
    This means we can now load just ycm_client_support (which is a much smaller
    library) into Vim and ycm_core into ycmd. Since ycm_client_support never depends
    on libclang.so, we never have to load that into Vim which makes things much,
    much easier.

    Vim still loves to block the main GUI thread on occasion when asking for
    completions... to counteract this stupidity, we enforce a hard budget of 0.5s
    for all completion requests. If the server doesn't respond by then (it should,
    unless something really bad happened), we give up.

    for the request being ready.

    We now only run extra conf preload for global file
    
    This changes functionality, but since this is an undocumented, non-public API,
    it's fine. The reason this is required is because of issue #579; if we try to
    run extra conf preload on non-global extra conf, we might not have the
    permission to load it. The global extra conf is something the user explicitly
    has to set so it's always fine to load that.

    Fix issue with slow cursor moving in Python
    
    This happened when moving the cursor in normal mode. The problem was that we
    were calling SyntasticCheck on every cursor move because YCM would think that
    the FileReadyToParse event processing returned diagnostics... but YCM only
    integrates with Syntastic for C-family files.
    
    Fixed by only triggering SyntasticCheck in C-family files.

    Fixing the diagnostic-related race conditions
    
    Now, every FileReadyToParse event returns diagnostics, if any. This is instead

    We now handle the starting FileReadyToParse event
    
    The problem was that when you start vim like "vim foo.cc", the FileReadyToParse
    event is sent to the server before it's actually started up. Basically, a race
    condition.
    
    We _really_ don't want to miss that event. For C++ files, it tells the server to
    start compiling the file.
    
    So now PostDataToHandlerAsync in BaseRequest will retry the request 3 times
    (with exponential backoff) before failing, thus giving the server time to boot.

    No more threading in completers!
    
    The server is multi-threaded and will spawn a new thread for each new request.
    Thus, the completers need not manage their own threads or even provide async
    APIs; we _want_ them to block because now were implementing the request-response
    networking API.
    
    The client gets the async API through the network (i.e., it can do something
    else while the request is pending).

    Ignoring failed event notifications
    
    These happen rarely and are not a big deal when they do. We still log them to
    the Vim message area, but we don't annoy the user with the default, in-your-face
    Python traceback.

    Now parsing file on every normal mode cursor move
    
    This is still fast & efficient because if we detect that the buffer hasn't been
    changed (by examining b:changedtick), the parse doesn't proceed.
    
    In effect, we now make sure we parse the file after every change to the buffer
    as soon as that change happens. This means that compilation error feedback will
    now be much, MUCH quicker.

    Dev flags are now off by default
    
    "Dev" flags are -Werror, -Wextra, -Wall and -Wc++98-compat. People who are
    compiling YCM as users and not developers (99.99999% of all YCM compilations)
    don't care about those flags and were just burdened by their inclusion by
    default.
    
    Fixes #502.

    Now parsing file on insert mode leave as well
    
    We used to do it on buffer enter and cursor hold. Doing it on insert leave too
    produces much quicker compilation error feedback when editing C-family code
    because the user doesn't have to wait for the next cursor hold event.

    Better smart-case query-candidate matching
    
    Previously, "Foo" would match "Foo" but not "FOO". Now it matches both. Bottom
    line, an uppercase char matches only uppercase chars but lowercase chars can
    match either. We used to insist that lowercase chars in the query match
    lowercase chars in the candidate strings IF the query also had uppercase
    letters; this was dumb and a poor user experience.
    
    Fixes #501.

    Using b:changedtick for change detection
    
    For now, doing it just for detecting whether a change was made on move in insert
    mode.
    
    Using b:changedtick instead of our homebrew way of detecting the changed should
    be both faster and more robust.

    Better completion in the middle of a word
    
    For instance (`|` represents the cursor):
      1. Buffer state: `foo.|bar`
      2. A completion candidate of `zoobar` is shown and the user selects it.
      3. Buffer state: `foo.zoobar|bar` instead of `foo.zoo|bar` which is what the
      user wanted.
    
    This commit resolves that issue.
    
    It could be argued that the user actually wants the final buffer state to be
    `foo.zoobar|` (the cursor at the end), but that would be much more difficult
    to implement and is probably not worth doing.
    
    Fixes #374.

    Can now seed identifier database with keywords
    
    By toggling the g:ycm_seed_identifiers_with_syntax option, the user can now tell
    YCM to seed the identifier database with the language's keywords.
    
    This is off by default because it can be noisy. Since the identifier completer
    collects identifiers from buffers as the user visits them, the keywords that the
    user cares about will already be in the database, regardless of the state of the
    new option. So the only keywords added will be the ones the user is not using.
    
    Meh. But people want it so there.

    Better thread safety in IdentifierCompleter
    
    Everything that needs access to filetype_map_ has been split into a new class
    called IdentifierDatabase. This class is thread-safe. Previously, multiple
    threads could access filetype_map_ at the same time, some reading things from
    it, others writing to it. WTF was I doing? My best guess is that I introduced
    this vile stupidity when I added the second thread to IdentifierCompleter;
    previously it was impossible for multiple threads to stomp on filetype_map_
    because only one thread ever accessed it. I changed that some time ago and
    forgot to protect filetype_map_.
    
    Idiot.

    Fix breakage of some compile_commands.json users
    
    Depending on the user, the PrepareClangFlags rewrite of a few commits ago could

    message because the compiler executable string was not removed from flags
    upstream if the user prepended some flags to the output of PrepareClangFlags
    before returning it to the caller of FlagsForFile.
    
    Since the rewrite was supposed to be backwards compatible, this needs
    to be handled.

    Preventing possible TypeError with StringVec
    
    It was possible to get a traceback if results[ 'flags' ] was a StringVec; the
    code would try to perform results[ 'flags' ] += self.special_clang_flags and
    this would then fail because the clang flags would be a Python list.

    Calling PrepareClangFlags is not needed anymore
    
    ycm_extra_conf.py files used to import clang_helpers and then use the
    PrepareClangFlags function; this is now unnecessary since the logic from that
    function has been moved to flags.py. The old PrepareClangFlags function is still
    there (it just returns the flags it gets) for the sake of backwards
    compatibility with old ycm_extra_conf.py files.

    to an infinite loop in CompletionsForQuery.
    
    Fixes #270.

    This was done by introducing a new ThreadedCompleter class that descends from
    Completer. Both JediCompleter and FilenameCompleter descend from
    ThreadedCompleter.

    Rewriting the code from the pull request
    
    This implements the filename completer and introduces integration with
    UltiSnips. The user will now see snippets in the completion menu. After
    selecting a snippet, the user should invoke the UltiSnips trigger key
    (which should be changed from the default of TAB) to trigger the snippet
    expansion.
    
    Fixes #77, Fixes #36

    Supporting YcmCorePreload logic
    
    Now the user has the option of writing custom logic before ycm_core.so is

    is loaded by prepending paths to sys.path.
    
    Very, very few people will need this feature, but I'm one of them so there.

    Possible fix for random hang on Vim close
    
    Reparse would take the clang lock and then possibly call Destroy while still
    holding the lock. Destroy would try to take that same lock, and the mutex is not
    recursive. Unpleasantness ensues.
    
    I _think_ this is the root cause of #218, but I can't be sure. Such is life with
    threads.
    
    Fixes #218.

    Add jedi-based completion.
    
    This first version only uses the Jedi completion engine after a ".", similar to
    how the ClangCompleter works. It is also entirely synchronous and blocks for
    quite a while the first time it is called.

    Making the omni completer more robust
    
    - There was a bug in not calling int() on the result of the first call to the
    omnifunc.
    - We need to be more resilient to badly written omnifuncs and check that the
    result of the second call is a list or a dict with a list, as the vim docs say
    the omnifunc should return on the second call.
    
    One of the two fixes probably fixes #198 but since I can't repro the error, I
    can't be sure.

    Select correct triggers for multiple filetypes
    
    The base class completer Inner chose the first filetype available and
    would use the triggers for it.
    
    The triggers are now chosen considering the first for the current buffer
    that is supported by the current completer. If there is no intersection,
    it fallsback to considering the first filetype for the buffer.

    Check for a native completer with multiple filetypes
    
    GetFiletypeCompleter would always return a omnicompleter for the first
    filetype in case there was no native completer, and the lookup would
    stop.
    
    This changes that behaviour to get all possible completers and tries to
    find a native one among them. If no native completer is found, it
    returns the omnicompleter for the first filetypes, as it used to.

    Support for multile filetypes in clang_completer
    
    clang_completer would check if the raw value of '&ft' was one of
    supported filetypes for the completer.
    
    Vim allows for multiple filetypes with a '.' separator. A file with
    ft=qt.cpp, for example, would not be supported by clang_completer even
    though it was a cpp file.
    
    This patch changes that behaviour.

    Not using the system libclang by default
    
    We used to do this but it was unsafe, as issue #167 proves. YCM has to give
    libclang an include to YCM's copy of clang system headers (again, see issue #167
    for details) and those headers may not be valid for a newer libclang.
    
    If the user really wants to user the system libclang, then he can just always
    call cmake himself. The installation guide in the README goes to great lengths
    to explain the simple process of building YCM "by hand".
    
    Fixes #167.

    Ask before loading .ycm_extra_conf.py files
    
    To prevent the execution of malicious code the new default is
    to ask the user before a `.ycm_extra_conf.py` file is loaded.
    This can be disabled using the option `g:ycm_confirm_extra_conf`.
    
    This commit introduces a helper class `FlagsModules` that keeps track of
    and caches the currently loaded modules. To introduce further criteria
    for a module look at `FlagsModules.ShouldLoad`.
    
    Also `:YcmDebugInfo` now lists the file that was used to determine
    the current set of flags.
    
    `Flags.ModuleForFile` could be used in a user-facing command that
    opens the `.ycm_extra_conf.py` corresponding to the current file.
    A second command could then force a reloding of this module via
    `Flags.ReloadModule`.

Author: Strahinja Val Markovic <val@markovic.io>
Date:   Sat Feb 23 17:34:10 2013 -0800

    A few more clang cursorkinds supported
    
    Now C-family completion will have fewer compeletion strings labeled as 'u' kind.

    Docs linking to Windows installation wiki page
    
    That wiki page along with the last several commits that make YCM compiled
    cleanly with MSVC should make it possible to use YCM on Windows. Fixes #62.

    Removing ycm_core.dll as allowed name
    
    I'm pretty sure that allowing ycm_core.dll was wrong. Python docs state that the
    extension for compiled Python modules on Widows is "pyd"; see this link for more
    details: http://docs.python.org/2/faq/windows.html#is-a-pyd-file-the-same-as-a-dll
    
    Key quote from the page:
    "Of course, foo.pyd is required if you want to say import foo."
    
    CMakeLists.txt has been previously updated to produce a ycm_core.pyd on Windows,
    not a ycm_core.dll.

    Fixes #143.

    Let local YCM config file override global config file
    
    Currently, when VIM opens a source file, YCM always defaults to

    This commit changes YCM's behaviour so that it first tries to find the config
    file in the source file's folder (or any of its parents folder), before
    falling back to 'g:global_ycm_extra_conf_file'.

    Changing the wording of the warning to recompile
    
    Since YCM now checks for the version of the ycm_core library, the user will
    always know when he needs to recompile.

    The docs now reflect the new omni-completer
    
    ... and the new, fleshed-out Completer API.
    
    YCM now provides semantic completions for every language that Vim has
    omnicomplete support for, which is _a lot of them_.

Date:   Tue Feb 12 20:30:14 2013 -0800

    Actually stopping compilation when no support
    
    Previously we would just emit an error message _and continue_. The "and
    continue" part was an embarrassing oversight.

    Better triggering of semantic completion
    
    Now there's a nice user-configurable setting for when YCM should trigger
    semantic completion. This is very useful for the new omni_completer that uses
    data coming from Vim's omnicomplete system.

    New YcmDiags command that shows diagnostics

    New Syntastic API forces us to select YCM
    
    Previously, Syntastic would pick YCM as the default checker if YCM was
    installed. The new Syntastic API does not do this. I don't know is this a bug or
    not (talking to upstream), but until it's resolved, YCM has to force the use of
    itself.

    Supporting multiple filetypes set for current file
    
    Vim allows setting the filetype string to something like "cpp.c", which means
    that the file is both cpp and c (nonsense, but allowed). We need to support such
    filetype strings.

    Race condition fix; caused latency on first load
    
    The issue was that the user could open a C-family file and have it start
    compiling in the background. While it is still compiling, he could trigger the
    completion system with a member dot operator. Because the file was still
    compiling for the very first time, the TranslationUnit object was yet not
    created. Sadly, this meant that UpdatingTranslationUnit would return false, and
    a new query request would be created, the GUI would hang until it was done
    aaaaand terrible lag until the file was compiled.
    
    This was a very rare edge case that could also only be triggered if it takes a
    considerable amount of time to compile the file.

    Better support for CompilationDatabase
    
    We now use the compilation working directory for a file that is specified in the
    CompilationDatabase. We don't actually change the working directory of the

    coming from the database so that all the relative paths in them are resolved to
    absolute ones.

    Final workaround for bug with vim-notes use
    
    The vim-notes plugin adds 'longest' to completeopt in its filetype plugin. This
    breaks ycm. The result is that the user can't type at all after a notes file has
    been visited.
    
    We work around this by setting our completeopt settings on every buffer visit
    and CursorHold event.

    Fix for hang on insert enter after "foo.bar"
    
    If the user had code like "foo.bar" and then entered insert mode after the 'r'
    in "bar", YCM would cause vim to hang.
    
    The problem happened because a sorting task was created that would try to sort
    on the latest clang result but none would be created because a clang task was
    not created in this occasion. clang_data_ready_ would remain false and would
    never be set to true, thus causing an infinite loop in SortingThreadMain since
    the thread would forever wait on the mutex.
    
    This was rectified with better handling of the clang results cache. Now the
    cache is a full class and it also stores the line & column number of the
    location for which the results were computed. Better logic is in place for the
    cache invalidation.

    Fix for "lclose not allowed here" error on open
    
    The problem was caused by a race condition of all things. ClangCompleter would
    set possibly_completions_ready when starting the first parse pass for the file
    and then would try to extract diagnostics for the file before the diagnostics
    were done. Technically this was not a problem because only an empty diagnostics
    vector would be returned, but this triggered Syntastic because hey, we have some
    diagnostics to show (even though we don't).
    
    And then Syntastic would try to close the location list window during startup
    when this operation is not available. Technically it's Syntastic's fault, but a
    more principled way to check for done diagnostics is to return and use a future
    for file parsing operations and this solution also works around the Syntastic
    issue.

    Possible fix for rare completion-repeat bug
    
    On rare occasions a bug can occur where the user is trying to type text but the
    completion system is erasing it as he types. I believe this new approach should
    fix that problem. It also replaces the old system for preventing an infinite
    loop to occur when there are no completions to show to the user.

    Refactored the clang completer; many bugs fixed
    
    This change should fix the random hangs and segfaults when using the clang
    completer. Also, assertion errors printed to the console on vim exit should go
    away too, same thing with segfaults on vim exit. These "on exit" errors were
    caused by not cleanly shutting down the background threads; both the identifier
    completer and the clang one now join the threads on destruction. This results in
    a clean shutdown.
    
    The new clang completer architecture now uses only one clang thread (again)
    instead of a completion and parsing thread. Since the parsing task needs to wait
    on the completion task if it was started first (and vice-versa) there's no point
    to using two threads. The desired "simplicity" of using two threads for these
    two tasks actually created needless complexity (and bugs). Sigh. Such is life.
    
    A TranslationUnit abstraction was also created and this in turn also reduces the
    complexity of the clang completer.
    
    The clang completer now also has some (very) basic tests.

    The completion text in the menu is different. We used to just show the func name
    in the "main" part of the completion menu, now we show the full signature
    without the return type (which is shown on the right)

    Adding the cursor identifier on InsertLeave
    
    This should help catch cases where the user jumps to an identifier and then
    edits it in place; we want to add that new ident to the db ASAP because the user
    may want to have it completed soon.
    
    Still, we're not perfect. If the user just deletes chars with 'x' or 'd' in Vim
    and therefore never even enters insert mode we are obviously not going to pick
    up that identifier until the next full file sweep.

    with the compiler-provided one.

    Using the vector indexing suite from Boost.Python
    
    This removes the need for a special overload for AddCandidatesToDatabase. Also,
    the GetFuture function now provides a more sensible API with the list being
    returned instead of accepted as an out parameter.

    We DO want clang to be tracked in our in-tree llvm
    
    The llvm gitignore file removes all clang files from revision control. Not what
    we want in our case.

    Renaming our gtest targets to gtest_ycm
    
    llvm also has a copy of gtest in its source tree. This causes cmake to bork
    since it sees several different targets with the same name (gtest and
    gtest_main). So we have to rename our versions of gtest and gtest_main to
    something else... We're just appending _ycm now.
    
    This will cause pain when we want to update gtest in the future from upstream,
    but I don't see a better way of handling this.

    Fixed another bug in the word boundary condition
    
    The problem was that should have been using a longest common subsequence
    algorithm for the "number of word boundary character matches" calculation. Our
    old approach would fail for the following case:
    
    Query: "caafoo"
    
    Candidate1 : "acaaCaaFooGxx"
    Candidate2 : "aCaafoog"
    
    Candidate1 needs to win. This is now also a test case.

    New sorting rule: char match index sum
    
    The point is that we want to prefer candidates that have the query characters
    "earlier" in their text, e.g. "xxabcxxx" over "xxxxxabc" for "abc" query.
